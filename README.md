Julius -> warframeAPI.ipynb / augur_reach_xlsx:
This is a snippet from a project of my own(Julius) that i started to practice python on the first day.
I became sick wed/thursday the 8th and therefore it is not as thorough as i would've wanted, in terms of considerations

This project has the intent of making potential profit clear for myself while trading in the videogame Warframe. the API is from a third party, warframe.market.
Warframe.market acts as a trading hub, wherein users post trades. Other users will be able to click "buy", which give a string of text they can paste into the game to contact the seller.
Users have accounts with account names.

Mikkel -> web_scraping_philosophy_books.ipynb / philosophy_books_data.csv

My program gathers information about current philosophy books for sale. The data includes details such as title, price, reviews, and availability. Once the data is collected, it undergoes a minor cleanup and is then saved in a .csv file. Subsequently, the program reads the .csv file, and the data is presented appropriately.
