Julius -> warframeAPI.ipynb
This is a snippet from a project of my own(Julius) that i started to practice python on the first day.
I became sick wed/thursday the 8th and therefore it is not as thorough as i would've wanted, in terms of considerations

This project has the intent of making potential profit clear for myself while trading in the videogame Warframe. the API is from a third party, warframe.market.
Warframe.market acts as a trading hub, wherein users post trades. Other users will be able to click "buy", which give a string of text they can paste into the game to contact the seller.
 Users have accounts with account names.
